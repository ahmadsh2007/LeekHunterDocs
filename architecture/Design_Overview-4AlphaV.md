# LeekHunter â€“ Architecture Overview (Alpha)

---

## ðŸ”§ Purpose

LeekHunter is an AI-powered bug detector designed to analyze source code using Gemini API and highlight potential bugs directly within the developer's code editor (VS Code). This document outlines the systemâ€™s architecture and its key components.

## ðŸ§± System Components

### 1. **Prompt Engine**
- **Language:** TypeScript / Python (For Now)
- **Role:** Constructs structured prompts for the Gemini API and injects code dynamically.
- **Future:** Custom fine-tuned LLM may replace Gemini later.
- **Status:** Actively tested with multiple prompt versions.

### 2. **Gemini API (GoogleGenAI)**
- **Library:** `google.generativeai`
- **Usage:** Sends prompt + code â†’ Receives JSON response
- **Status:** Stable; verified for multiple prompt versions

### 3. **Bug Parser / Validator (Planned)**
- Parses and validates JSON from Gemini
- Ensures correct field types: `bug_description`, `fix_suggestion`, `line_number`, `severity_level`
- ***NOTE***: Validations are performed manually 

### 4. **Code Scanner (Planned)**
- Scans project files in a directory (multi-language support: Python, JS, TS)
- Feeds each file into the prompt engine

### 5. **VS Code Extension (Planned)**
- Highlights bugs in real-time using the VS Code diagnostics API
- Displays bug tooltips: line number, severity, fix
- Optionally shows fix suggestions in a sidebar or hover card
