## Progress Summary From 2025-06-22 to 2025-07-23

### Summary of Work Completed
- Integrated CLI functionality and support for the AI Engine with dynamic input file handling
- Implemented Vscode APIs to check on code , for example Vscode WorkSpace hooks (onDidChangeTextDocument) to allow monitoring and real time analysis
- Successfully Updated Our GeminiAPItesting script to run via CLI and file path arguments 
- Established More Dynamic handling for better automation and flexibility 

### Bugs and Dataset Testing
- Multiple `.py` files checked to confirm new functionalities, Yielded Great results.
- Multiple bugs were found and dealt with, For example:  
1- `.ts` file executions errors,
2- Wrong Command usage before slicing extra argument lines in commands
3- VScode hooks and APIs crashing/not triggering due to bad setup ( User Error)
- Fixes: 
1-  Used  --loader ts-node to run `.ts` correctly
2- Added argument slicing for CLI version of AI Engine

### Tools and Libraries Used
- Node.js/ TypeScript
- ts-node
- VScode and VSCode APIs
- AI Engine (Changes due soon)

### Challenges / Issues
- CommonJS conflict while executing .ts scripts
- Misunderstanding of how Node handles file extensions without a loader
- Gemini API not yet integrated, testing limited to static file analysis logic


### Next Steps
1.  Add dynamic analysis and Real-Time logging
2. Package everything together after bug-fixing and release Alpha version of LeekHunter as an extension
3. Improve logging and performance
4. Integrate Gemini API for dynamic analysis in files/codes
