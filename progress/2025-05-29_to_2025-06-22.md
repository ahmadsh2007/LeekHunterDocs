## ðŸ§ª Progress Summary: May 29 â€“ June 22

### Gemini API Integration  
- Tested Gemini API keys with both Python and TypeScript environments  
- Confirmed stable, functional API responses in custom prompting scenarios  

### Custom Text Prompting Tests  
- Developed prompts to identify bug types, line numbers, explanations, and fix suggestions  
- Validated Gemini's ability to output structured bug analysis in both Python and JavaScript  

### Bug Dataset Testing  
- Python files tested: 6 with 7/7 bugs identified  
- JavaScript files tested: 4 with 22/23 bugs identified  
- Bugs are ranged from Low to Critical

### Tools Used  
- Gemini API (Gemini-Flash/ Gemini-Pro)  
- TypeScript (Node.js, axios, Gemini SDK)  

### Next Steps  
1. Bug Category:
    Value: A standardized string (e.g., "Logical Error", "Security Vulnerability", "Performance", "Code Style", "Readability", "Best Practice Violation").
    Why it's needed: It provides a higher-level classification than just the description, allowing for better reporting and faster triaging of issues.
2. Confidence Score:
    Value: A numerical value (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) or a qualitative string ("High", "Medium", "Low").
    Why it's needed: It transparently communicates the AI's uncertainty, especially when dealing with poorly-named, ambiguous code. It's the key to building user trust.
3. Begin developing VS Code extension and VSCE UI scaffold
